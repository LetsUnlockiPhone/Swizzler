## Key Features

1. Proxy App Traffic
   A key feature of Swizzler is to proxy traffic of an app irregardless of whether the app adheres to the iOS HTTP Proxy. This is done by hooking the Obj-C Foundation Methods NSURLConnection and NSURLSession.

   To enable proxying of traffic, enter the proxy server IP and Port, enable the wanted proxy method, close the app and restart.

   TBD!
